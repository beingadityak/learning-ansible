# Learning Ansible

This Repository contains multiple tasks which are achieved using Ansible. Most of the code is tested in Virtual Machines created using Vagrant. Some sub-tasks might have their specific `Vagrantfile` for provisioning VMs as per the task's requirements (in most cases, it is generic).
